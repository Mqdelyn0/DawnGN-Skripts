    low_lag_protection: 0.1 + ((20 - tps from the last minute) / 4) * 2 # These are used for code that generally isn't intensive, So you can leave it at pretty low numbers.
    medium_lag_protection: 1.5 + ((20 - tps from the last minute) / 2) * 2 # These are used for code that are kind of intensive, Like hologram reloading, Loops, And what not.
    high_lag_protection: 6 + (20 - tps from the last minute) * 2 # These are used for code that are what I think, really intensive, Like setting a lot of blocks, Or just in simple codes, YANDEREDEV CODE TYPE SHIT
